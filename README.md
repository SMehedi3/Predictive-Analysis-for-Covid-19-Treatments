# Predictive Analysis for Covid 19 Treatments
This project applies Predictive Analytics to analyze and forecast Covid-19 treatment availability using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset, obtained from the Medicare & Medicaid Services Dataset (https://healthdata.gov/ASPR/COVID-19-Treatments/xkzp-zhs7/about_data), provides details on healthcare providers offering FDA-approved Covid-19 treatments, including Paxlovid, Lagevrio, and Veklury.

## Stages of the project:
Data preprocessing
Exponential Smooting for time-series forecasting
K-Means Clustering for provider segmentation
Multiple Linear Regression for causal analysis
